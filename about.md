### WhoAMI?

My name is Grant Visser and I'm a third year BCIS Applications Development and Networking, and Business Systems double major student at Monash South Africa.

I live in Randpark Ridge, South Africa.

I'm a dog person. Which automatically makes my dog cooler than yours.

I'm also a car person, but I drive a Honda. So. There's that.
